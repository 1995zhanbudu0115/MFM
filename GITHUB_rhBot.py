# Details       : Bot used to browse reddit and collect data on stocks based
#				  on user comments. There are large assumptions made, as is the 
#                 case with paper trading, but they will be explained as they 
#				  come up.

# rhBot currently accesses a subreddit on Reddit and does the following:
# 	1. Accesses all submissions/comments that happened on searchDate. The submission text is only collected 
#       when the submission is originally made, otherwise the submission is just searched for comments.
#       To be collected: searchTimeStart < submission text/comments < searchTimeEnd 
#   2. Pool all comments
#   3. Sort through comments 1-by-1 and collect all ticker symbols
#   4. Dump raw data from comment with ticker symbol into DataLog.csv 
#      a. Action,Stock,Price,Author,Comment,Sub,Time,Date
#   5. Count the number of times a stock is mentioned and update StockHits.csv (REMOVED TO BECOME SEPARATE FUNCTION)
#      a. Stock, day_1-month-year, day_2-month-year, ... day_N-month-year
#   6. Access WatchList.csv and either update metrics for existing ticker mentioned (REMOVED TO BECOME SEPARATE FUNCTION)
#      today or add a new ticker. Metrics are below
#      a. STOCK, Price, Market Cap, Avg Volume, Rel Volume, EPS (ttm),
#         P/E, P/S, RSI (14), SMA20, SMA50, SMA200, Shs Outstand,
#         Short Float, Insider Own, Volatility, Change, Earnings, 
#         Sales, Insider Trans, Dividend, Last Update

    First Validate any optional inputs. Check searchDate, searchTimeStart, and searchTimeEnd input 
    with the validateDateText and validateTimeText functions. If any of them are None (or improperly 
    formatted which returns None from validate functions), then use todays date and the entire day as
    the search span.
    Then check filePath, if it is None or not found to exist, use the directory python is being called in.
    Finally check postLim, mainly just to make sure it's not less than 1 and that it is an integer. Reddit
    has a hard limit on the maximum number of posts that can be pulled and if postLim is higher than that
    it will just default to Reddit's hard limit.
